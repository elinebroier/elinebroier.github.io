    <div class="roze">About me</div>
    <div class="textborder">My name is Eline Broier. I live in a small village nearby Roosendaal called Wouwse Plantage, 
        and I live there with my parents and my younger sister. 
        We have six cats and a dog. 
        <br> I went to primary school in Wouw. 
        After that, I went to the secondary school in Roosendaal,
         named Jan Tinbergen College where I did HAVO.
         <br>
         My favorite book is The horse wisperer, because it's a beautiful story.

    <div class="roze">My hobbies are:</div>
    <div class="textborder">During my leisure time I like to draw, bake and read books. 
        I like horse riding, moutain biking. My aunt has her own horse, called Astrid. 
        I enjoy/love going to Astrid with my aunt to go for a outdoor ride. 
        After we returned  from the outdoor ride we go mountain biking trough the forest.
        I also enjoy hiking. We do this a lot with our family and with my dog.
        My dog is called Guusje. She is almost eleven months old. 
        Guusje and I go to the puppy training every week.
        Photography is also one of my hobbies, I mainly photograph flowers.
