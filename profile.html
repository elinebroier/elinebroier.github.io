    <div class="roze">About me</div>
    <div class="textborder">My name is Eline Broier. I live in a small village nearby Roosendaal called Wouwse Plantage, 
        and I live there with my parents and my younger sister. 
        We have six cats and a dog. 
        <br> I went to primary school in Wouw. 
        After that, I went to the secondary school in Roosendaal,
         named Jan Tinbergen College where I did HAVO.

    <div class="roze">My hobbies are:</div>
    <div class="textborder">During my leisure time I like to draw, bake and read books. I don't have a favorite genre, 
        but there is one book that is my favorite: The horse whisperer. 
        I like horse riding, moutain biking. My aunt has her own horse, called Astrid. 
        I enjoy going to Astrid with my aunt to go for a outdoor ride. 
        After we return from the outdoor ride we go mountain biking trough the forest.
        I also enjoy hiking. We do this a lot with my family and with my dog.
        My dog is called Guusje. She is almost eleven months old. 
        Guusje and I go to the puppy training every week.
        Photography is also one of my hobbies, I mainly photograph flowers. 
        I like gardening, I have my own kitchen garden.
