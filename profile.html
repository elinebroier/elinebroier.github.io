    <div class="roze">About me</div>
    <p>My name is Eline Broier. I live in a small village nearby Roosendaal called Wouwse Plantage, 
        and I live there with my parents and my younger sister. 
        We have six cats and a dog. 
        <br> I went to primary school in Wouw. 
        After that, I went to the secondary school in Roosendaal,
         named Jan Tinbergen College where I did HAVO.
         <br>
         My favorite book is The horse wisperer, because it's a beautiful story about life.
