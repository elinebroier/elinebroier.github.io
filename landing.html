    <div class="roze">Why HBO</div>
    <div class="textborder">I have visiteds many different schools and study programs. 
        At university you get a lot of theory and i would struggle with learning that much theory. 
        That's why the HBO level suits me because I am practical and learn better in practice. 
        What appeals to me are the (group)projects you have to do.
        The study programme suits my personality because I like to learn new things. 
        I am creative and I like to solve problems. 
        I like interaction with other people.
