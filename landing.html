    <div class="roze">Why HBO</div>
     <div class="textborder">I have visiteds many different kind of schools and study programs. 
        At university you get a lot of theory and i would struggle with learning that much theory. 
        That's why the HBO level suits me because I am practical and learn better in practice. 
        I like that at HBO you work result-oriented. 
        The study programme suits my personality because I like to learn new things. 
        I am creative and I like to solve problems. 
        I also like interaction with other people.
        What appeals to me are the (group)projects you have to do and the feedback you get.
        You can learn a lot from that feedback and benefit from it.
        What I also like about ICT is that technology keeps on developing. So there are lot of challenges. 
        There is diversity in ICT jobs.
        Funny detail: my grandfather on my father's side worked in the ICT world. My dad worked as director of ICT at the HBO in Rotterdam.
